I'm a software developer living in Bath, England. I work for [Event Store LLP](http://geteventstore.com), which produces an open source stream database with a built-in projections system ([here](http://github.com/EventStore/EventStore) on GitHub).

However, this is a personal blog, which will hopefully cover a large range of topics in time. For Event Store related things, check out the [Event Store Blog](http://geteventstore.com/blog). I'll fill out more of this page eventually!
