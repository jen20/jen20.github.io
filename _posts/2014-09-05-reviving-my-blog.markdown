title: "Reviving My Blog!"
---

It's been almost a year since my last post here, largely because I never
bothered to get Octopress working again after my laptop rebuild because of Ruby
hell. However, now enough people have asked me to write posts about my boxen,
dotfiles, Packer and Vagrant setups for Windows development on a Mac, I've
finally put some time into fixing it (thanks in no small part to boxen sorting
out most of the the ruby-related crap for me) and moved the blog from Octopress
running on Heroku to plain Jekyll (even with the default theme!) running on
GitHub Pages.

The workflow will take some getting used to (I really need to write a Makefile
to generate the filename and front matter for new posts, for example), but I'm
pretty happy with the results so far, and will actually start blogging about
(hopefully) useful stuff - though my Event Store related posts can still be
found mostly on the [Event Store Blog](http://geteventstore.com/blog) rather
than here.
